---
In an article entitled *Developing Scientific Computing Communities*,
author Aaron Dubrow cites Cactus as an example of "Modular Software for
Community Growth." After giving a brief summary of its core
capabilities, he lauds Cactus as a "successful \[model\] of community
code creation and evolution."

The article quotes Dr. Gabrielle Allen, Cactus co-author and originator,
on her vision of the Cactus community's aim: "to provide the core
computational tools than can enable new science, broaden \[the\]
community, facilitate interdisciplinary research and take advantage of
emerging petascale computers and advanced cyberinfrastructure."
