<p> In an article entitled <i>Developing Scientific Computing Communities</i>,
author Aaron Dubrow cites Cactus as an example of "Modular Software for
Community Growth." After giving a brief summary of its core capabilities, he
lauds Cactus as a "successful [model] of community code creation and evolution."</p>

<p> The article quotes Dr. Gabrielle Allen, Cactus co-author and originator, on
her vision of the Cactus community's aim: "to provide the core computational
tools than can enable new science, broaden [the] community, facilitate
interdisciplinary research and take advantage of emerging petascale computers
and advanced cyberinfrastructure." </p>
