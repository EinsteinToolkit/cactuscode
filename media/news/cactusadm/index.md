The [SPEC](http://www.spec.org) computer-benchmarking consortium has
released the 2006 edition of their widely used performance benchmarking
suite: SPEC CPU 2006. [(see the official
release).](http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/press/release.html)

This includes 12 integer
([CINT2006](http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/CINT2006/)) and 17
floating-point ([CFP2006](http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/CFP2006/))
benchmarks, together with standard ways of combining their benchmark
results into single integer and floating-point performance indices.

[CactusADM](http://www.spec.org/auto/cpu2006/Docs/436.cactusADM.html)
was tested on different platforms and found to be relevant and suitable
for one of the 17 CPU-intensive benchmarks. CactusADM benchmark was
prepared by Malcom Tobias from Center for Computational Biology,
Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis and is based on the
[BenchADM benchmark](http://www.cactuscode.org/old/Benchmark/) that was
used as a core Cactus benchmark for many years.

SPEC is known as probably the most widely used benchmark in the computer
industry for evaluating the performance of processors and compilers.

In particular, compiler developers put a lot of effort into tuning
compilers to work well on the SPEC benchmark, so having Cactus in the
SPEC suite should lead to compilers doing a better job on our code.

With this release, CactusADM benchmark joins application benchmarks from
other intensive scientific applications in different fields, such as
GAMESS, ZEUS, WRF, GROMACS and NAMD.
