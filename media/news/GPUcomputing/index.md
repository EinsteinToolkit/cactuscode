title: CCT researcher accelerates Einstein code with GPU computing
sitemap_exclude: true
---
Using the Cactus Computational Toolkit, CCT researcher, Dr. Burkhard
Zink, solved Albert Einstein's field equations for general relativistic
gravitation on a graphical processing unit (GPU). The benchmark results
of his work show that the GPU can improve the computation of finite
difference codes solving these equations.

Dr. Zink's work is part of a larger project in which researchers and
NVIDIA collaborate on [GPU Petascale
Computing](http://www.hpcwire.com/hpc/2092380.html).

More information about his results can be found in the CCT Technical
Report Series, 2008, ["A General Relativistic Evolution Code on CUDA
Architectures"](http://www.cct.lsu.edu/CCT-TR/CCT-TR-2008-1)
