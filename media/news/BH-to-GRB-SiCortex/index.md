### March 17, 2009: Webcast: *From Black Holes to Gamma-Ray Bursts*, hosted by SiCortex

LSU Center for Computation & Technology Researchers Steven Brandt and
Erik Schnetter presented the results of their research on the
computational challenges of gravitational physics, the use of the Cactus
framework for modern black hole evolutions and modeling Gamma-Ray Bursts
(GRB) in a recent webcast, hosted by SiCortex, Inc.

LSU has developed a Cactus simulation of an inspiraling binary black
hole system using over 5,800 cores for large-scale testing and online
remote visualization. At SuperComputing 2008, the largest uniform grid
evolution of a black hole collision to-date was performed using an
800<sup>3</sup> sized data set.

During the webcast, Drs. Schnetter and Brandt also discuss how their
simulation results will be used to carry out further scientific research
and identify ways to improve scaling and performance.

This webcast is part of a series of Science-to-Science webcasts
sponsored by SiCortex and intended to highlight the use of HPC systems
in advancing scientific discovery. The webcast and associated white
paper, Relativistic Astrophysics on the SiCortex Architecture, can be
viewed [on the SiCortex
