**March 2007:** Scientists from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
and Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory have chosen Cactus to be one of
the six scientific applications used in the evaluation of the
performance of six of the world's fastest supercomputers.

Cactus has successfully demonstrated impressive scalability up to 32K
processors on the BGW system and showed extremely promising results,
suggesting that the application will scale to larger petascale systems.

More about the experimental results in [*"Scientific Application
Performance on Candidate PetaScale
Platforms"*](http://crd.lbl.gov/~oliker/papers/ipdps07.pdf) , winner of
the Best Paper Award, International Parallel & Distributed Processing
Symposium (IPDPS), March 24-30, 2007, Long Beach, CA.
