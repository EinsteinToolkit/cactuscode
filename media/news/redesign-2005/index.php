<p>
CactusCode.org has been redesigned.
</p>

<p>
The old Cactus Webpages served us well for many years, but we decided that the time was right to reorganize and redesign them. During the Summer of 2005 a new site was developed, primarily by Jeff DeReus and Dylan Stark at CCT, using Plone software. The new site will be officially released on October 3rd 2006, and we hope that these pages will make it easier for you to find information on using and developing Cactus, and also make it possible for our community to contribute to improving the pages. Special thanks go to Haytham H. Hemadeh for his work on the new cactus header.
