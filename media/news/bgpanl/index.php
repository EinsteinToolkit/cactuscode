<p>
During the <a href="https://www.alcf.anl.gov/events/workshops/scaling_workshop08/">Leap to Petascale Workshop</a> held at the <a href="http://www.alcf.anl.gov/">Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF)</a> in July 2008, the Cactus team successfully ported the Cactus framework to the Blue Gene/P system at the <a href="http://www.anl.gov/">Argonne National Laboratory (ANL)</a> and conducted benchmarking runs on up to 131,072 cores (out of 163,840 cores available).
</p>

<p>
There are two IBM Blue Gene/P systems, <a href="https://wiki.alcf.anl.gov/index.php/Quick_Reference_Guide">Intrepid and Surveyor</a>, installed at ANL. <br>
<ul>
<li>Intrepid has 40,960 quad-core compute nodes (163,840 cores) with a peak performance of 557.1 TFlop/s.</li>
<li>Surveyor has 1,024 quad-core compute nodes (4096 cores) with a peak performance of 13.6 TFlop/s.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Although Intrepid is ranked as the world's third fastest supercomputer in the <a href="http://top500.org/list/2008/06/100">31st TOP500 list</a> in
June 2008, it is the world's fastest open science supercomputer. The Cactus team carried out standard weak scaling benchmarking runs with uniform grid driver PUGH on Intrepid on up to 131,072 cores with a local grid size of 50<sup>3</sup> and 60<sup>3</sup> respectively. The total number of grid points of the biggest run is 3048<sup>3</sup> or about 28.3 billion, which is the largest simulation that the Cactus team has ever performed on any supercomputer so far. The benchmark used is the kernel of a numerical relativity code which evolves the Einstein equations to model black holes and gravitational waves.
The almost perfect weak scaling behavior of Cactus on the Blue Gene/P system as shown in the figure below indicates that Cactus is ready to leap to the Petascale.
