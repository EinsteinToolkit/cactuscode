title: Funding received for phase two of the Parca project
---
**April 2007:**

NASA awarded another [STTR
grant](http://www.sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/05/sttr/phase2/STTR-05-2-T4.02-9864.html)
for the "Interfacing the Paramesh Computational Libraries to the Cactus
Computational Framework" proposal.

During the [first phase](/media/news/Paramesh) of the project,
researchers at CCT - where the PI is Dr. Manuel Tiglio - and [Decisive
Analytics Corporation](http://www.dac.us/) developed an interface
between the Paramesh computational libraries and the Cactus
computational toolkit.

The project enhances and broadens the collaboration between the
computational fluid dynamics and numerical general relativity
communities, having a significant importance for NASA.
