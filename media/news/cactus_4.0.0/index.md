We are pleased to announce release 4.0.0 of the Cactus computational
toolkit. This release includes new features like support for CUDA
compilers, support for new architectures and comes bundled with
supporting tools like GetComponents and Simfactory. Also, CactusExternal
is now deprecated in favor of the better infrastructure in
ExternalLibraries. In addition, bug fixes accumulated since the previous
release in February 2009 have been included.

Read more about the new release in the longer [release
notes](http://cactuscode.org/download/releasenotes/Cactus_4.0.0).
