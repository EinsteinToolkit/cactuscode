title: Success with the PARAMESH Grant

PARAMESH Grant for the development of a Cactus driver.

Recently, [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov) awarded an [STTR
grant](http://sbir.gsfc.nasa.gov/SBIR/SBIR.html) to a collaboration of
[Decisive Analytics Corporation
(DAC)](http://www.decisive-analytics.com/home.html) and [Louisiana State
University (LSU)](http://www.lsu.edu). In this
[project](http://sbir.gsfc.nasa.gov/SBIR/sttr2005/phase1/awards/2005firm.html),
we will design and implement a [Cactus](http://www.cactuscode.org)
driver which is based on
[Paramesh](http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~olson/paramesh-doc/Users_manual/amr.html),
a parallel adaptive mesh refinement library. This project is called
"Parca", a mixture of the words "Cactus" and "Paramesh".

A driver in Cactus manages storage for variables and implements
communication for parallel processing. A driver is the heart piece for
the efficient use of supercomputers. Parca will be a third driver for
Cactus, next to PUGH, a highly efficient unigrid driver, and the mesh
refinement driver Carpet \[http://www.carpetcode.org/\]. Parca will
implement a somewhat different mesh refinement algorithm than Carpet,
and will make the knowledge and experience that is build into Paramesh
available to Cactus users.

Our partner at DAC is David Fiske, who received a PhD in numerical
relativity from the [University of
Maryland](http://www.physics.umd.edu/grt/). David Fiske will visit the
CCT from June 5 to 9.
