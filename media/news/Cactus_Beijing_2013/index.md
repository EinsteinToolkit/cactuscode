invited talks presented by Steven R. Brandt and Frank Löffler this year
in Beijing, China.

Brandt and Löffler presented Cactus and the [Einstein
Toolkit](http://einsteintoolkit.org/) to faculty of the [Department of
Computer Science and
Technology](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/csen/) at Tsinghua
University, at the [State Key Laboratory of Scientific and Engineering
Computing (LSEC)](http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/), at the [Institute of Applied
Physics and Computational Mathematics](http://www.iapcm.ac.cn/), and to
a high-performance-computing class at Tsinghua University.

This visit and these talks mark the beginning of a scientific
collaboration. We made a joint proposal for computer time on Titan, and
are planning a scientific paper in the near future.
