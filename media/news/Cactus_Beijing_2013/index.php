 "仙人掌：高性能计算开源框架" (Cactus: An open-source framework for
 high-performance computing): That was the title of one of the four invited
 talks Steven R. Brandt and Frank Löffler presented this year in Beijing, China.
</p>
<p>
 The two leaders of the Cactus project had been traveling to <a
 href="http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/then/">Tsinghua University</a> to
 visit <a ref="http://hpclab.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~duzh/">都志辉 (Zhihui Du)</a>, Associate
 Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Technology.
</p>
<p>
 Apart from ... collaboration ... Brandt and Löffler presented Cactus and the
 <a href="http://einsteintoolkit.org/">Einstein Toolkit</a> to faculty of the
 <a href="http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/csen/">Department of Computer
 Science and Technology</a> at Tsinghua University, at the <a
 href="http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/">State Key Laboratory of Scientific and
 Engineering Computing (LSEC)</a>, at the <a
 href="http://www.iapcm.ac.cn/">Institute of Applied Physics and Computational
 Mathematics</a>, and to a high-performance-computing class at Tsinghua
 University.
</p>
<p>
 ... Something about the future of this collaboration ...
