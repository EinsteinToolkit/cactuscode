<p><em>IEEE Sidney Fernbach Award (2006)</em></p>
<p>
	  <table>
	    <tr>
	      <td valign=center> Dr. Edward Seidel has been awarded one of the most prestigious awards for "outstanding contributions in the application of high performance computers using innovative approaches". The IEEE computer society recognized Seidel for outstanding contributions to the development of software for high-performance computing and grid computing to enable the collaborative numerical investigation of complex problems in physics, particularly focusing on modeling black hole collisions.
