We are pleased to announce release 4.2.0 of the Cactus computational toolkit,
an open source problem solving environment designed for scientists and
engineers. This release includes various changes to the flesh, support for new
architectures and comes bundled with supporting tools like GetComponents and
Simfactory. In addition, bug fixes accumulated since the previous release in
November 2012 have been included.

Cactus provides computational scientists and engineers with a collaborative,
modular and portable programming environment for parallel high performance
computing. Cactus can make use of many other technologies for HPC, such as
HDF5, PETSc and PAPI, and several application domains such as numerical
relativity, computational fluid dynamics and quantum gravity are developing
open community toolkits for Cactus.

Cactus allows you to develop code in your language of choice: F77, F90, C, C++,
Cuda and OpenCL are all supported â€” developers write their own components,
which we call "thorns" which are connected together by the Cactus "flesh".
Developers and users can take advantage of a selection of existing
computational thorns, as well as a growing number of domain specific thorns.

Cactus runs on a wide range (just about all) architectures and operating
systems. Cactus is being used as the basis for numerous projects in
computational science, and new technologies such as Grid computing, parallel
file I/O, adaptive mesh refinement are very quickly available to our users.

Cactus is developed and supported by an international team of computational and
computer scientists, based largely at the Center for Computation & Technology
at Louisiana State University.

The Cactus Framework is partially supported by NSF

(CIGR), and also by NSF 0905046/0941653 (PetaCactus) and 0710874 (LONI Grid).

Significant Changes
-------------------

* simfactory
** updates of various machine configurations
** remove existing default allocations; use local configuration to use these
* Cactus flesh:
** Do not buffer output from thorn configuration scripts
** Introduce OPTIONAL_IFACTIVE for thorn dependencies
** Automatically activate required thorns
** Support IBM Blue Gene Q compilers
** Change the parameter parser to Piraha
** Implement CCTK_Error and friends (marked as non-returning for the compiler)
** Replace Cactus complex number type with C/C++ complex numbers
** Workaround for compiler-bug with Intel compiler and 'restrict'.
       In particular, for the current and recent Intel compilers (version 13),
       the 'restrict' keyword is disabled in Cactus code by default, because
       the compiler tends to produce wrong code otherwise.
