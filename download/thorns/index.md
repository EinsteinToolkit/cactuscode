This page describes standard thornlists for Cactus.

-   The Cactus Computational Toolkit includes thorns supported and
    developed by the Cactus Team that provide general computational
    infrastructure  
    [development
    version](https://bitbucket.org/cactuscode/utilities/raw/master/ThornLists/Cactus_devel.th),
    [current stable version
    4.3.0](https://bitbucket.org/cactuscode/utilities/raw/Cactus_4.3.0/ThornLists/Cactus_4.3.0.th)
-   The WaveToy example evolves a 3D scalar field. This application is
    one of the simplest examples of a solving a hyperbolic partial
    differential equation using finite differences, and so provides a
    very good learning example of how a PDE can be solved within the
    Cactus framework. The WaveToy application is provided in each of the
    programming languages supported by Cactus.
