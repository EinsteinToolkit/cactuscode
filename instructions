INSTRUCTIONS
for internal use

important:
there is a template file located at /global/template.php that should be copied for all new pages.  add html content between the php tags at the top and bottom.  modify the php variable ($title) at the top of the file with the title of the page.

using index.php:
//todo - make clearer
when you want a page to be accessible from its directory path only (ex: cactuscode.org/news/stories/), simply copy the global template (/global/template.php) to the folder and name it index.php.

linking to pages without file extension:
//todo

linking:
it is preferable to use non-absolute links when pointing to pages inside the cactus website.  an example would be <a href="/download/">linked text</a>.  this particular link would work from any page on the cactus website, since it begins with a slash, but notice that it is not necessary to include "http://www.cactuscode.org" as long as there is an initial slash.

media/other files:
add photos or other files directly to the directory with the pages that will use them.  this makes it easy to keep them managed and easy to link them.
once you've added a photo to the directory of the page, you can simply use the <img src="photofilename.jpg" alt="short description" title="An optional attribute that appears on mouseover." /> tag to include it in a page.

some useful html tags:
to separate paragraphs, surround paragraphs of text with <p></p> tags.
for bold, use <strong></strong> tags.
for italic, use <em></em> tags to emphasize.
to distinguish blocks of code from other text, use <code></code> tags.
for in-line code snippets, variables names, or to simply show text in fixed width, you can use <kbd></kbd> tags.
for subheadings, use <h3></h3> tags.  (the main page's title is level h2.)
for block quotes, use <blockquote></blockquote> tags.
if you need a line break without the extra spacing that happens around a real paragraph, use the self-closing <br /> tag.
the <hr /> tag is used for a horizontal rule (line).
you can define an acronym by using the <acronym title="definition here"></acronym> tags around it.

if you need to use a table to show data, use tags like the following.
<table>
	<tr> <!-- row tag -->
		<th>heading 1</th> <!-- table heading tag -->
		<th>heading 2</th> <!-- use one th tag per column of the table -->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>this is a cell in row 1</td>
		<td>this is the second cell</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>this is a new row</td>
		<td>last cell of the table</td>
	</tr>
</table>

if you need to present a list, ordered or unordered, use tags like the following.
<ol>
	<li>Here is an example</li>
	<li>of an ordered list</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Here is an example</li>
	<li>of an unordered list</li>								
</ul>
