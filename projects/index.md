---
The Cactus framework is the basis for a set of other projects that build
on the infrastructure that it provides.

-   [Alpaca](www.cct.lsu.edu/~eschnett/alpaca) develops Cactus Tools for
    Application Level Profiling and Correctness Analysis
-   [CaFunWave](cafunwave/index.html) is a wave equation solver using
    GPUs.
-   [XiRel](http://www.cct.lsu.edu/xirel) develops a Next Generation
    Infrastructure for Numerical Relativity
-   [Einstein Toolkit](http://www.einsteintoolkit.org) a community-driven
    software platform of core computational tools to advance and support
    research in relativistic astrophysics and gravitational physics.
