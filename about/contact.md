We recommend using our [Mailing Lists](/about/mailinglists/index.php) to
ask questions about Cactus concerning how to use and develop for it. If
you want to contact the [Cactus Team](/about/team/) directly, you can
mail to <cactusmaint@cactuscode.org>.

We welcome comments and feedback about what you use Cactus for, your
experiences with it, and any suggestions for improvement.
