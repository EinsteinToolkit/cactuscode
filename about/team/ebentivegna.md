### Position

-   Postdoctoral researcher, Louisiana State University

### Background

-   Laurea in Fisica, Universit√† di Catania (Italy)
-   PhD in Physics - minor in High Performance Computing, Penn State
    University (U.S.A.)

### Research

My research is centered around the numerical simulation of systems
governed by the laws of General Relativity, ranging from black holes to
the large-scale universe, and around the computational tools required.
In particular, I develop high-level debugging and visualization tools
within the [Alpaca](http://www.cactuscode.org/Development/alpaca)
project and have an interest in numerical methods for the extraction of
physical observables from the simulations (horizon analysis, wave
extraction).
