This HOWTO describes how to monitor and steer a Cactus job using 
a web browser. Please help us to keep this documentation complete 
and up-to-date by sending complaints, suggestions and errata to 
the Cactus Team at cactusmaint@cactuscode.org and werner@aei-potsdam.mpg.de

0. CVS REPOSITORY

   All the thorns mentioned here are from the current development version
   of Cactus (4.0 Beta 9) and should be checked out from the development
   CVS repository
 
   cvs -d :pserver:cvs_anon@cvs.cactuscode.org:/cactusdevcvs co <name> 

1. Introduction

   Compiling and running Cactus with thorns which act as web servers
   makes it possible to connect to a running Cactus job with a web 
   browser, monitor the simulation, and interact with the run, for 
   example changing the values of steerable parameters or terminating   
   the job. The functionality available will depend on the thorns 
   providing the web server capability. 

2. Required thorns

   Here we will describe how to use thorns available with the standard
   Cactus release to provide web server functionality. 

  	CactusConnect/HTTPD
	CactusConnect/HTTPDExtra
	CactusConnect/Socket

   The first thorn here, CactusConnect/HTTPD provides the full implementation
   of the web server. In addition, HTTPD provides the following functionality
   and content

	- status report of the simulation
	- a password protected control panel for pausing, restarting or 
          terminating the simulation.
	- password protected pages for steering parameters 
	- full information about all parameters and variables in the
	  active thorns
'
   Thorn HTTPDExtra can be optionally used to provide additional features, 
   including
 
        - collaborative message board
	- download page for output files
        - viewport for inline visualisation of certain filetypes

   Thorn Socket is a utility thorn required by HTTPD. It provides
   low-level socket I/O functionality.
 
   The web server thorns can be used to serve and display output files
   created by Cactus, currently 1D line plots and Jpegs. This requires 
   CactusConnect/HTTPExtra, in addition to the usual thorns needed for output,
   that is

   - for 1D line plots

 	CactusBase/IOUtil
	CactusBase/IOASCII
	CactusPUGH/PUGHSlab
	CactusPUGH/PUGH

   - for Jpegs

 	CactusBase/IOUtil
	CactusPUGH/PUGH
	CactusPUGH/PUGHSlab
	CactusIO/IOJpeg
	CactusExternal/jpeg6b
       
   These thorns must be included in both your ThornList for compilation,
   and the ActiveThorns parameter in your parameter file for running 
   Cactus.

3. Running Cactus with Thorn http

   When you run a Cactus parameter file including these thorns, you will
   see a message appear saying something like

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Server started on http://gullveig:7089/
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [The URL will consist of the host where you are running Cactus 
    together with a port number]

   This message indicates that Thorn HTTPD is listening on port 7089 
   of the machine gullveig for HTTP requests. See below for more information
   about the port number and associated problems.

4. Connecting to the Cactus simulation

   From any other machine, start up a web browser and point it to the 
   indicated URL. As long as Cactus is still running, you will see the 
   Simulation Home Page.

5. Changing or "steering" parameters

   Before you can steer parameters, you need to authenticate yourself
   by going to the Control Page. The default username and password are
   both anon, although these can be set to different values in the parameter
   file.	

   Following the link to "Parameters", provides a list of Active
   thorns. Clicking on a thorn name shows two lists of parameters and 
   their current values for the thorn, separating the Steerable parameters 
   from the Fixed parameters.
  
   To change a steerable parameter simply change the value in the input
   box by its name, and press the submit button.

   For example, steerable parameters might include IO options such as 
   which grid variables to output, and how often to output them. A more 
   complex steerable parameter could be the timestep for an evolution run.
   Note that the presence of a steerable parameter, and the HTML input box
   only indicates that it is possible to change the parameter, not that
   it is necessarily meaningful to do so ... badly thought out steerable
   parameters could provide confusing or catastrophic consequences if 
   changed.

6. Viewing 1D output from thorn IOASCII 

   If you have included the IO thorns, and have e.g. the graphics package
   xgraph installed on your machine, you can view 1D output. First, make
   sure that you have configured your browser correctly to read the
   xgraph output (see below). 

   Go to the "Files" page, where a list of available files for download
   or visualisation is provided. Clicking on any filename with the 
   extension .xl, .yl, .zl or .tl should pop up an xgraph window displaying
   the data.

   To add or remove IOASCII grid variables, go to the "Parameters" page,
   and then to "IOASCII" and edit the values of "out1d_vars" and 
   "out1d_every". To see possible grid variables to output, follow the 
   link in the menu to "Groups and Variables"

7. Configuring a web browser to read xgraph files

   To configure your browser to read xgraph output from CactusBase/IOASCII,
   
   Netscape 4.x
	- Select <Edit/Preferences> from the toolbar
	- Select <Navigator> and then <Applications> from the category 
          menu
	- Select the <New...> button. File in the fields as follows:
	
	  MIMEType: application/x-graph
	  Application: xgraph %s
   
8. Thorn http Web server port number

   The port number on which Thorn HTTPD listens for HTTP requests is 
   a parameter choice for "httpd::port" in Thorn HTTPD, which defaults 
   to the value 5555. Only one instance of Thorn HTTPD can be listening 
   at each port, and if the chosen port is already in use (for example
   by another Cactus run), HTTPD will automatically try to find 
   the next free port number. (This behaviour can be disabled using the
   parameter httpd::hunt)

9. Jpeg images.

    It is also possible to view jpegs of 2D slices from 3D grid functions.
    To make use of this feature you need to compile with

	CactusExternal/jpeg6b
	CactusIO/IOJpeg
	CactusConnect/HTTPD
	CactusConnect/HTTPDExtra
	CactusConnect/Socket

    The Jpeg images will be displayed on the Viewport page of the 
    Simulation server.

10. Example

#== BEGIN THORNLIST FILE
