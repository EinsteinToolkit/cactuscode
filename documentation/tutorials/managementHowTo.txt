Management-HOWTO

v1.1, 2 December 2000

This HOWTO explains how to conveniently get hold of, and compile 
the thorns you want on different platforms. Please help us to keep 
this documentation complete and up-to-date by sending complaints, 
suggestions and errata to the Cactus Team at cactusmaint@cactuscode.org .


Introduction
------------

Probably the most difficult aspect of using Cactus for the first time,
is finding out which thorns need to be compiled for a given application.
We're still working on how to make that process easier, and this HOWTO
describes the best current way to manage different Cactus configurations.

You may also want to read the HOWTOs describing the various Cactus CVS
repositories (CactusRepositories-HOWTO), and the Computational Toolkit
(ComputationalToolkit-HOWTO).


ThornLists
----------

Maintaining and saving ThornLists for your different Cactus applications
is the best way to easily checkout and compile on different machines. A 
ThornList simply contains a list of thorns and optionally embedded 
directives describing the CVS servers where they can be found.

If all your thorns are available from CVS servers, you can checkout
everything you need for an application on any machine by running

perl GetCactus <ThornList>

You can run this even if you already have a version of Cactus checked out,
to get additional thorns.

You can also use a ThornList to compile just the thorns you need for a 
given application as well. In the Cactus home directory type

gmake <configuration-name>-config <other options> \
	THORNLIST=<filename> \
	THORNLIST_DIR=<directoryname>


ThornList Syntax
----------------

Thorns are listed in a ThornList by giving the arrangement and thorn names,
in the form

<arrangement name>/<thorn name>

Comments can be added to a ThornList using the "#" symbol. Anything following
the # on a line is ignored.

Directives are indicated by a "!" at the beginning of the line. Directives 
apply from the point in the ThornList they occur, until they are optionally
redefined. The syntax for a directive is

!<directive> <assignment>

Current directives are

  DESC
    Description of this thorn list (not currently used)

  REPOSITORY_TYPE
    Type of CVS repository used, e.g. pserver

  REPOSITORY_TAG
    Tag to use for checking out of CVS repository

  REPOSITORY_USER
    Username for checking out of CVS repository

  REPOSITORY_NAME
    Name of CVS repository (position in filesystem)

  REPOSITORY_LOCATION
    Name of machine hosting CVS server

  REPOSITORY_MODULE
    Location of the thorn in the CVS repository (if the location is
    not <arrangement>/<thorn>).

Configuration Files
-------------------

Configuration files allow you to save options for configuring Cactus,
for example, compiler flag options, MPI locations. This is useful, since
it allows you to save a configuration file for each machine that you 
use, e.g. you might save origin.config, t3e.config. Or you might save 
useful compiler flags for debugging etc.

If a configuration file is used, additional options may also be specified
as usual on the command line. Currently, any option in a configuration
file overides an option on the command line.

To configure Cactus from such a file, use

gmake <config>-config options=<filename>


Example Configuration File
--------------------------

# MPICH-G2 ON ORIGIN
GLOBUS_LIB_DIR=/opt/globus/deploy/lib
MPICH_DIR=/opt/mpich-1.2.1
MPICH_DEVICE=globus
MPI=MPICH
HDF5=yes
