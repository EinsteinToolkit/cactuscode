This HOWTO describes how to compile and run Cactus using the Globus
MPICH libraries. Please help us to keep this documentation complete and 
up-to-date by sending complaints, suggestions and errata to the 
Cactus Team at cactusmaint@cactuscode.org 


1. Globus

   Globus is a research and development project which is focused on 
   enabling the application of Grid concepts to scientific and 
   engineering computing. The web pages for Globus, where you can download
   the Globus Toolkit and related software, and find documentation, are 
   located at www.globus.org.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   You *do not* need the Globus Toolkit in general to compile or use 
   Cactus. Using the Globus Toolkit with Cactus simply provides you with
   easy access to Grid enabled computing.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   The job submission, data handling, and tracking features of Globus can 
   be used with any Cactus executable, here we describe how to make use
   of the grid enabled MPICH libraries (MPICH-G2) which provide an easy way
   to run simulations across multiple machines.

   Once Cactus is compiled with the Globus MPICH libraries, it can be run 
   using an RSL script as any other application would be run using Globus. 
   Please consult the Globus documentation for running applications with
   the Globus toolkit.


2. Version Information

   Cactus (Beta 8 and higher) will compile with the old Globus 1.0.x and 
   the current 1.1.x versions. It is fully tested with the latest version of 
   Globus 1.1.4 and the Globus device from MPICH 1.1.2.

   Note that the Globus device only works with MPICH 1.2.1 or MPICH versions
   later than 1.2.2.3, see the MPICH-G2 web page http://www.globus.org/mpi/
   for more details.

   Cactus (Beta 12 and higher) was also tested to build with Globus 2.0
   and MPICH-G2 on a few platforms (SGI Irix and Hitachi SR8000) but we
   do not officially support Globus 2.0 in Cactus yet (for build options
   with Globus 2.0 and MPICH-G2 see the following section).


3. Compiling Cactus with Globus

   Cactus can be compiled for running with the Globus toolkit which means
   that you have access to Globus features like resource management, data
   management and information services. If your driver thorn uses MPI for 
   domain decomposition (the standard driver thorn CactusPUGH/PUGH does 
   use MPI) you can compile Cactus with the 1.x Globus device of MPICH or
   with Globus 2.0 and MPICH-G2, which is the Globus device for Globus 2.0.
   You can perform distributed runs across a heterogeneous setup. MPICH-G2
   can be downloaded via the Globus web pages at http://www.globus.org/mpi.

   To compile Cactus with MPICH globus device and the Globus 1.x Toolkit

   a) Install Cactus on your machine (see QuickStart-HOWTO for instructions
      on installing and using Cactus for the first time, or for more details
      the User Guide). Suggested initial application thornlists for testing 
      purposes are the WaveToy set of thorns (WaveToy.th) or the benchmark 
      application (BenchADM.th), these can be found on the Cactus web pages.

   b) To configure Cactus, decide on a name for your configuration, 
      for example testglobus, and in the Cactus home directory type

      gmake testglobus-config MPI=MPICH \
	      		      MPICH_DIR=<mpich-installation-directory> \ 
     		              MPICH_DEVICE=globus \
                              GLOBUS_LIB_DIR=<globus-library-directory>  

   c) To build a Cactus executable, you should now be able to simply type

       gmake testglobus

 
   To compile Cactus with Globus 2.0 and MPICH-G2

   a) Install Globus 2.0 and MPICH-G2 on your machine
 
   b) To configure Cactus, choose a configuration name (e.g. G2) and type

      gmake G2-config MPI=CUSTOM \
                      CC=<mpich-G2-installation-directory>/bin/mpicc
                      CXX=<mpich-G2-installation-directory>/bin/mpiCC
                      F90=<mpich-G2-installation-directory>/bin/mpif90
                      LD=<mpich-G2-installation-directory>/bin/mpiCC
 
   c) To build a Cactus executable, you should now be able to simply type
  
      gmake G2


4. Running Cactus with Globus and MPICH-G2

   To run your Globus version of Cactus, you need to use an rsl script, 
   as with any other Globus application. You cannot currently run Cactus' 
   automatic testsuite system with Globus, this will hopefully change in 
   later versions.

   Example:

	globusrun -f test.rsl

   where test.rsl containts

+(&(resourceManagerContact="origin.aei.mpg.de")         (* where to run the job  *)
    (count=4)                                   	(* this selects 4 CPUs   *)
    (label=globustest)                          	(* convenient job name   *)
    (environment=(GLOBUS_DUROC_SUBJOB_INDEX 0)          (* first subjob          *)
    (directory=/data/user/Cactus/exe/)     	        (* where to find the exe *)
    (executable=cactus_testglobus)   			(* what to run           *)
    (arguments=testglobus.par)                          (* which arguments       *)
    (stderr=err) 					(* standardout           *)
    (stdout=out)                                        (* standarderr           *)                                                
)

(&(resourceManagerContact="modi4.ncsa.uiuc.edu")        (* where to run the job  *)
    (count=8)                                           (* this selects 8 CPUs   *)
    (label=globustest2)                                 (* convenient job name   *)
    (environment=(GLOBUS_DUROC_SUBJOB_INDEX 1)          (* second subjob         *)
    (directory=/data/user/Cactus/exe/)                  (* where to find the exe *)
    (executable=cactus_testglobus)                      (* what to run           *)
    (arguments=testglobus.par)                          (* which arguments       *)
    (stderr=err)                                        (* standardout           *)
    (stdout=out)                                        (* standarderr           *)
 
)

  this starts a job on 12 processors.
