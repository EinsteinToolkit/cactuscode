General Information about VizLauncher
-------------------------------------

  The intention of the VizLauncher package is to provide a set of tools
  to Cactus users which allow easy monitoring and live visualizations
  on your local machine, or remote jobs running on machines anywhere
  else in the world.

  The current version of the VizLauncher package contains a perl script
  which is to be used as a Netscape browser helper application to
  automatically launch visualization programs on data that is produced
  by a remote Cactus job.

  VizLauncher also works from the command line on files in your local 
  file system.

  The remote datafiles are accessed via the Cactus HTTP webserver interface
  and downloaded by the browser. The VizLauncher perl script will then
  run an appropriate visualization tool, according to the MIME type of the
  downloaded data.


  Currently the following visualizations can be launched by the VizLauncher:

    * xgraph
      - trace line plots of scalar/reduction output from thorn 
        CactusBase/IOBasic
      - 1D line plot of 1D output from thorn CactusBase/IOASCII

    * gnuplot
      - trace line plots of scalar/reduction output from thorn 
        Cactus/Base/IOBasic
      - 1D line plot of 1D output from thorn CactusBase/IOASCII
      - 2D surface plots of 2D output from thorn CactusBase/IOASCII

    * IsoView
      - 3D isosurface plots of streamed isosurface data from thorn
        CactusPUGHIO/IsoSurfacer

    * OpenDX
      - arbitrary multidimensional plots of streamed HDF5 data from
        thorn IOStreamedHDF5 and file-based HDF5 data from thorn IOHDF5

    * h5ls, h5dump
      - ASCII dumps of streamed HDF5 data from thorn IOStreamedHDF5
        and file-based HDF5 data from thorn IOHDF5


  For detailed information about these visualization tools and how to get
  them please refer to our Cactus VizTools webpage

Download and Install VizLauncher
--------------------------------

  The VizLauncher package is available via anonymous checkout from
  the Cactus CVS server:

      cvs -d :pserver:cvs_anon@cvs.cactuscode.org:/cactus login
          [ password is 'anon' ]
      cvs -d :pserver:cvs_anon@cvs.cactuscode.org:/cactus  \
          checkout -d VizLauncher VizTools/VizLauncher

  This downloads a perl script named VizLauncher which now needs to be
  registered as an application to the Netscape browser to handle the MIME
  types used to advertise all the different output data on the Cactus
  simulation side.
  The VizLauncher package provides the following two files for that
  purpose:

    * mailcap

      This file associates several MIME types used by Cactus output
      with the VizLauncher application. Either copy this file
      to .mailcap in your home directory, or append your existing .mailcap
      file.

      The path to the VizLauncher script should be set properly,
      either by editing the .mailcap file or by setting the VIZLAUNCHER_DIR
      environment variable to point to it.
      To prevent warning messages from the VizLauncher, you should also
      comment out all lines for visualizations tools which you don't have
      installed on your local machine.

    * mime.types
      This file associates the file extensions of Cactus output files
      with the appropriate MIME types as specified in the .mailcap file.
      Either copy this file to .mime.types in your home directory, or 
      append your existing .mime.types file.

      With these mappings you will also be able to launch visualizations
      on local Cactus output files - simply by clicking on them in the
      browser's file selection window.

  To install these two files, just copy or append them in your HOME
  directory or to the system's default mailcap file location.
  The browser needs to be restarted then in order to activate the changes.


  VizLauncher itself might also need some customization if other than 
  the default settings should be used. This effects the scratch directory 
  for temporary files ('/tmp'), how to start an xterm
  window ('xterm -e'), and how to bring up a menu ('xmessage -center').
  See the default settings of these parameters at the top of the script.

  The VizLauncher script will search for visualization programs in
  locations according to the user's PATH environment variable.
  If a program cannot be found that way, the script should be adapted
  by putting the absolute path to the program into the VizTools database
  (found at the top of the script).

  In order to launch visualizations with OpenDX, the VizLauncher script
  needs to know where to find appropriate OpenDX networks. For that it
  will check the environment variable DX_NETWORK_DIRS which should
  contain a list of directories (separated by spaces) containing OpenDX
  network files (*.net).
  Some example OpenDX network files for both file- and stream-based
  visualizations are to be found in the OpenDXUtils package. For details
  please see the OpenDX-HOWTO.



Using VizLauncher
-----------------

  Once these steps were performed properly you should now be able to 

  * launch visualizations on a remote Cactus job (for example, check out 
    the perpetual run on the Cactus home page). Just connect to the 
    simulation HTTP webserver, go to the "Files" page for downloadable 
    files and click on one of the links.

  * view files in your local filesystem by typing

    VizLauncher <filename>



Details
-------

When recognizing files in the local file space, VizLauncher uses the following extensions:

asc -> gnuplot
xg,xl,yl,zl,dl -> xgraph
h5 -> HDF5

 

Further development plans
-------------------------

  The VizLauncher perl script was tested to work with the Netscape
  web browser. It would be nice to know how to use it from within other
  browsers as well.

  If you find other visualization tools suitable to process Cactus output
  data we would like to add them to the VizLauncher's VizTools database.

  Finally, we also want to develop more VizLauncher tools which can
  be used for visualization of live Cactus data, such as java-based
  applications or standalone programs with their own GUI's.


  Any suggestions or contributions regarding these development plans
  are highly welcome. Just send your comments to developers@cactuscode.org.
