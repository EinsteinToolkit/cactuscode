Visualization-HOWTO
Gabrielle Allen
v1.2, 11 July 2000

This HOWTO describes software and methods for visualizing data from 
Cactus simulations, which is created using the IO thorns in the 
Computation Toolkit thorns. Please help us to keep this documentation
complete and up-to-date by sending complaints, suggestions and errata
to the Cactus Team at cactusmaint@cactuscode.org 


1. Introduction

   At the moment most of the output thorns for Cactus are specialised to 
   3D grid functions. From these grid functions it is possible to output

     0D - timelines (max, min, etc)
     1D - lines along the axis and the diagonal
     2D - slices 
     3D - the entire data set

   The IO routines are currently being extended to include the output of
   1D and 2D grid functions.

   If the functionality you require is not provided by the standard IO 
   thorns please contact cactusmaint@cactuscode.org, or make a feature 
   request to the Bug Tracking system at www.CactusCode.org.


2. IO Thorns in the Cactus Computational Toolkit

   CactusBase/IOUtil
   CactusBase/IOBasic
   CactusPUGHIO/IOASCII
   CactusPUGHIO/IOFlexIO
   CactusPUGHIO/IOHDF5

    
3. Data Formats

   The following data formats are used by the above IO thorns

a) ASCII  (1D/2D using CactusBase/IOUtil and CactusPUGHIO/IOASCII)
	  (0D using CactusBase/IOUtil and CactusBase/IOBasic)

b) IEEEIO (2D/3D using CactusBase/IOUtil and CactusPUGHIO/IOFlexIO)
  
          For more information on the IEEEIO data format see

          http://zeus.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~jshalf/FlexIO/IEEEIO.html
   
c) HDF5   

          For more information on the HDF5 data format see

          http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/

          i) (2D/3D using CactusBase/IOUtil and CactusPUGHIO/IOHDF5)

             The data sets here have a layout optimised for Cactus with 
             a unigrid, and use native HDF5 n-dimensional arrays. There is
             HDF5 Hyperslab functionality available for readers.
 
          
4. Visualization Packages

   Here packages with which we have experience are described. If you know
   of others which can be used with Cactus data and should be mentioned, 
   please let us know.

a) xgraph (freely available) 

   Can be used to view 1D ASCII data created by CactusPUGHIO/IOASCII

   Can be downloaded from

   http://jean-luc.aei-potsdam.mpg.de/Codes/xgraph

   Supported platforms: Most 

b) gnuplot (freely available)
 
   Can be used to view 1D or 2D ASCII data created by CactusPUGHIO/IOASCII

   There are currently no provided scripts for viewing Cactus data.

   http://www.gnuplot.org/

   Supported platforms: Most

c) LCA Vision (freely available)

   Can be used to view 2D or 3D IEEEIO data created by CactusPUGHIO/IOFlexIO
   as well as HDF4 data which has been converted from the HDF5 format.

   http://zeus.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~miksa/LCAVision.html

   Supported platforms: SGI

   Current development: Port to Linux and HDF5 support

d) OpenDX (freely available)

   Can be used to view 1D,2D,3D HDF5 data created by CactusPUGHIO/IOHDF5
   or 1D,2D ASCII data created by CactusPUGHIO/IOASCII.
   Also allows the user to read streaming data.

   HDF5 reader modules and sample networks for OpenDX are part of the
   Utilities arrangement. (Utilities/OpenDXutils).
   
   The Cactus Developers are currently working on a thorn to write 2D and 3D 
   data in the OpenDx native format.

   http://www.opendx.org

   Supported platforms: Several

e) Amira (commercial, 30 day demo version)

   Can be used to view 2D and 3D IEEEIO created by CactusPUGHIO/IOFlexIO. 

   The FlexIO reader is available as part of the Numerical Relativity 
   add-ons to Amira. 

   http://amira.zib.de/

   Supported platforms: SGI, Linux, HP-UX, Sun Windows
   Supported platforms (Numerical Relativity add-ons): SGI, Linux

f) AVS (commercial)

   Can be used to view 2D and 3D IEEEIO data created by CactusPUGHIO/IOFlexIO
   as well as HDF5 data created by CactusPUGHIO/IOHDF5 (and HDF4 data which 
   has been converted from the HDF5 format). 

   Readers for IEEEIO can be found on the IEEEIO web pages.

   Supported platforms: 

g) IDL (commercial, multi-use 7 minute demo version)

   Can be used to view 1D and 2D ASCII data files created by 
   CactusPUGHIO/IOASCII, and 2D and 3D IEEEIO data created by 
   CactusPUGHIO/IOFlexIO as well as HDF4 data which has been converted 
   from the HDF5 format.

   IEEEIO readers can be downloaded from the Cactus Code web pages.

   Supported platforms: Most

h) NAG Explorer (commercial)

   Can be used to view 2D and 3D IEEEIO data created by CactusPUGHIO/IOFlexIO
   as well as HDF4 data which has been converted from the HDF5 format.

5. Using the Visualization Packages

   Here we will add information on how to use the various visualization 
   packages to view Cactus data. This information will be added as it is
   asked for.


6. Tools

a) Converting HDF5 data files to (flat) HDF4 data files

   A HDF5 to HDF4 converter is included in the HDF5 distribution
